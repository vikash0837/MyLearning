What is regularization in machine learning?
In case the question is "in layman's terms...": regularization artificially discourages complex or extreme explanations of the world even if they fit the what has been observed better. The idea is that such explanations are unlikely to generalize well to the future; they may happen to explain a few data points from the past well, but this may just be because of accidents of the sample.
