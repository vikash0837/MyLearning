There are following ways to persist container data:

Docker volumes

Docker commit

a) create container from ubuntu image and run a bash terminal.

   $ docker run -i -t ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash
b) Inside the terminal install curl

   # apt-get update
   # apt-get install curl
c) Exit the container terminal

   # exit
d) Take a note of your container id by executing following command :

   $ docker ps -a
e) save container as new image

   $ docker commit <container_id> new_image_name:tag_name(optional)
f) verify that you can see your new image with curl installed.

   $ docker images           

   $ docker run -it new_image_name:tag_name bash
      # which curl
        /usr/bin/curl
